# A Puppet Learning Path

Learning Puppet means learning DevOps. To mean, that means Ops and Dev.
Knowing Git, Programming and your OS, in addition to Linux, the ubiquititious Cloud OS is the baseline.
Much of our tooling, both Configuration Management, and (Workload) Orchestration are based around Promise theory.

So the field is ever expanding.
This is a snapshot.

This isn't clear, linear path. It can be meandering and looping. Here are some road-posts:
